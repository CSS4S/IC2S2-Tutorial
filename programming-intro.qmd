# Agent-based model programming in R

To help design effective sustainability interventions we can deduce which 
candidate intervention strategies are most effective in a
stylized agent-based models implemented and analyzed _in silico_. To best design
these models and understand how they work, it helps to understand our chosen
programming language and leverage available software packages that provides
useful tools. This includes some select software design concepts, most
importantly object-oriented programming. All the interacting _agents_ in
agent-based modeling are instances of one or a few _classes_, which define a
certain type of object. In other words, agent-based models are inherently
object-oriented, so we close this chapter on some relevant concpets from 
the theory of object-oriented programming.
