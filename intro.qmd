# Introduction

Indigenous peoples of the South Pacific Islands have managed coastal mangrove 
forest management to dissipate storm surges and prevent erosion, adaptations
that have mitigated potential costs of climate change since long before
human activity-driven (i.e., _anthropogenic_) climate change
[@Nalau2018;@Pearson2020;@]. 
First peoples of western North America have similarly practiced
prescribed burns to prevent destructive wildfires during times of drought since
long before anthropogenic climate change [@Eisenberg2019,@Kolden2019]. 
Despite the wide availability of ancient climate change adaptation knowledge 
and myriad modern innovations, maladaptive responses to climate change often 
take their place. In the South Pacific,
for example, some international aid groups promote sea wall construction instead
of mangrove forests, but these are expensive to maintain and can even act like
dams, keeping water in once it inevitably breaches [@Piggott-McKellar2020].
Forest management that limits thinning misses an opportunity to prevent
destructive wildfires, while clear-cutting can increase atmospheric carbon
dioxide and increase the risk of mudslides, possibly due to the polarized nature
of interests and opinions in public forest governance [@Swette2023]. 

The varied success of different sustainable practices to diffuse or not begs 
several questions, which we will address in this course. Analyzing these will
help us harness the positive factors promoting the spread
of sustainable behaviors and so we can avoid the pitfalls that impede
adaptation. First, what factors helped sustainable adaptations spread
in successful cases? Second, what factors hinder success, leading to
maladaptation? Finally, what patterns emerge when we 
collect and consolidate different studies analyzing these questions? While there
are many different cognitive, social, and environmental factors involved 
in any given sustainability outcome, we focus here on an emerging consensus about a
set of cognitive and social factors known to affect behavior choice in general,
and sustainable practices more specifically. 

In fact, this urgent need to
understand how sustainable behaviors spread in order to develop effective
interventions forces us social scientists to radically rethink how we
conceptualize social change to make it rigorous, reliable, and digestible by
non-social scientists. To support this effort, it will benefit us to frame
our work with the 17
[UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) that provide metrics for
evaluating progress towards a truly sustainable planetary ecology for all the
world's people. Recent analyses of progress suggests accelerated transformations
are required to reach goals necessary to avoid increasingly frequent and costly
climate change disasters [@UnitedNations2023]. Unfortunately, unless things
change, we can expect to "have 575 million people living in extreme poverty, 600
million people facing hunger, and 84 million children and young people out of
school. Humanity will overshoot the Paris climate agreement's 1.5Â°C 'safe'
guardrail on...temperature rise. And, at the current rate, it will take 300
years to attain gender equality" [@Malekpour2023, p. 250]. 

Sustainability, then, has several different dimensions, all of which contribute
to climate action and environmental protection. 
I have organized these goals into a coding system called the vIBE system, which
stands for _vibrant Institutions_ support _Basic_ human needs of people who protect
the _Environment_. This has two benefits. First, it helps us identify which
cognitive and social factors This organizes sustainable practices into those that 
A _social intervention_ (or just _intervention_) for promoting
sustainability is any concerted effort where those promoting a sustainable
practice introduces information about how to perform that practice to a
population. 





** BEGIN OLD STUFF **
_Sustainability_ is difficult to attain because it requires the participation of many people. People need reasons to practice certain behaviors. Our relationships with other people shape our behaviors, which are influenced by our beliefs and opinions which themselves, too, are shaped by our relationships with others. Things like the development and uptake of sustainable practices emerge from an incessant buzz of social activity including observation and evaluation, learning and teaching, movement and migration, discussion and deliberation. The widespread uptake of sustainable practices depends on other forms of social emergence, including healthy political systems, equality, justice, good public health, and social movements to work together to remedy or develop institutions meant to promote these things, like citizen groups, governments, and non-profits.

It would be great if we could scientifically design policies like architects design buildings. Architects first sketch buildings by hand, then computerize the design, where blueprints can then be evaluated for structural integrity, fire safety, ventilation, etc. We can rely on such computer-aided design systems because their calculations are scientific. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning efficiency, for example, can be calculated using principles of thermodynamics, the branch of physics that describes the behavior of large collections of particles like the billions upon billions of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and other molecules and elements in air.

Agent-based models of social behavior are in fact useful for exactly this, for creating and evaluating "blueprints" for interventions that simulate people as software *agents* who just intelligent enough to interact and make simple decisions. To make models interperetable and useful, we must identify and compartmentalize [@Cartwright1999] the most relevant parts of social systems for a particular policy problem. Social behavior is complex and highly sensitive to random changes. For example, maybe you get a dream job offer because you met someone on a train who had a friend visiting that works for an organization that does meaningful work and pays well.

This social randomness means we can't expect to calculate exact outcomes given some initial social conditions. Instead we must calculate distributions of possible outcomes by running multiple trials of the same model to understand the range of possible outcomes. One then inspects the distribution of outcomes for each set of *explanatory variables* that get defined in the model initialization. Explanatory variables represent different cognitive and social factors including agent learning and decision making and how social networks structure agent interactions. This modeling procedure is more like how weather forecasters give hurricane predictions compared to, say, measuring the mass of an electron to greater and greater precision. In every simulation of real-world hurricanes, the simulated hurricanes take a different path. The individual outcomes can then be aggregated to estimate the probability the hurricane takes a path within a "forecast cone" that spreads laterally forward from its current location [@fig-dunce-cone]. of a hurricane environment around real-world hurricanes cannot be experimentally controlled, and myriad unpredictable random factors affect their paths. On the other hand, measurement such as the mass of subatomic particles can be done to increasing precision as more and more experimental control of non-relevant forces are included. One consequence of this is that an investment in careful framing and visual analysis of model outcomes will pay dividends in terms of reader comprehension and potential for policy impact.

![Models of social behavior can only predict distributions of outcomes, just like how predictions of the path of hurricanes has a cone shape that expands over time representing greater variance and uncertainty.](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZm91cXZ1cnk5cnY3MWZjbDdqZmI4aWJpNW41Y28xb3VkYzV0a3lxMSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/j3766xIPcI45luQNQs/giphy.gif){#fig-dunce-cone fig-align="center" width="380"}

## The challenge of sustainable adaptation

-   The UN Sustainable Development goals provide a framework for

![United Nations Sustainable Development Goals help us organize critical dimensions of sustainability. Sustainability depends on some basic, minimal support for survival and education (Group B) that ensures the participation of all in institutions that develop interventions to promote sustainabile infrastructure and social capital (Group I). Healthy populations (Group B) combined with strong institutions (Group I) provide the necessary foundation for enforcing ecological and environmental protection (Group E).](images/clipboard-1689720362.png){#fig-sdg-organized fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Agent-based models for designing sustainability interventions and basic social science

-   *Collective sustainable adaptation* is difficult to attain because it requires individuals to change their expectations and behaviors. 

### Science-, agent-based models of social behavior for intervention design

- 

### Basic social science also needs agent-based models

-   Big, unanswered questions abound in social science whose answers could contribute to the application of social science to promoting sustainable behavior. Examples we will study in this course include 

1. How do different forms of uncertainty affect whether people prefer learning from others, trying new behaviors, or sticking with whatever behaviors are currently rewarding them the most.
1. How do people cognitively integrate previously-learned information, observations of the behaviors of others, and personal experience to 
1. What conditions tend to cause 


## Agent-based models and software

Agent-based models are a conceptual tool that represent individuals as *agents* whose behavior is governed by rules defined in software, as is their environment. In models of social behavior, agent-based models are defined by the several pieces of information they contain about the agents, the environment, and any other factors that might be relevant. Agents, too, represent a self-contained collection of features defining how these simulated people explore their environment, interact with others, choose behaviors, and tracking how many payoffs and neighbors they have.

In this course we will program our agent-based models using the R programming language and the `socmod` library developed for this computational social science for sustainability sequence of courses. As such, some familiarity with programming in R is necessary to do the coursework. In the next chapter we introduce programming in R using the `socmod`, `igraph`, and `tidyverse` packages. 

In the remainder of this chapter we introduce some basic R programming skills students will need to do problem sets and agent-based modeling generally. For this we  present an example of how to model the spread of an adaptive behavior in a core-periphery social network. These social networks are known to promote economic security.
