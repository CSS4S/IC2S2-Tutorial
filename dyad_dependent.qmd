# Diffusion of dyad-dependent coordination behavior

> In this section, we introduce coordination problems, where an individual's success depends not just on their own behavior but also on their partner's behavior. We distinguish two types: *correlative coordination*, where matching behaviors are beneficial (with *cooperation* as a key example), and *complementary coordination*, where different but complementary behaviors are needed. Both require social norms to stabilize successful outcomes.

Coordination problems involve *dyad-dependent payoffs*, unlike the *dyad-independent payoffs* discussed in the previous chapter.  
In the diffusion of sustainable, dyad-independent adaptations, only an individual's behavior determined their payoff.  
For example, sustainable mangrove forest management provides climate change adaptation benefits regardless of whether nearby communities also adopt the practice.

When the benefits of a behavior depend on others' behaviors, we have *dyad-dependent* payoffs.  
An individual's success depends on both their own behavior and their partner's behavior.  
We can still use the social learning–interaction–behavior update loop to model diffusion, with one key adjustment: the *interaction* block must now compute payoffs based on pairs of behaviors, not individuals alone.

We distinguish two broad types of dyad-dependent behavior:

- **Correlative coordination**  
- **Complementary coordination**

In **correlative coordination**, payoffs are maximized when partners match behaviors.  
**Cooperation is one type of correlative coordination**, where mutual cooperation yields the best outcomes but individuals are tempted to defect for short-term gain.  
However, not all correlative coordination problems involve temptation: sometimes simply matching behaviors is sufficient for success.

A classic example of a cooperation problem is the *Prisoner's Dilemma*.  
Two individuals must each decide whether to cooperate or defect.  
If both cooperate, they receive moderate benefits.  
If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gains more while the cooperator loses.  
If both defect, both suffer relative losses.  
Although mutual cooperation would be best, the temptation to defect creates tension between individual and collective interests.

In **complementary coordination**, payoffs are maximized when partners perform *different but complementary* behaviors.  
For example, in ballroom dance, without a shared convention, partners might both step forward and collide or both step back and lose contact.  
Social norms, such as men stepping forward first and women stepping back, solve the coordination problem by prescribing complementary roles.

Norms play critical roles in both types of coordination:
- In cooperation, norms suppress defection and sustain mutual cooperation.
- In complementary coordination, norms establish role expectations and prevent chaos.

Both cooperation and complementary coordination involve dyad-dependent payoffs, but differ in the behaviors required for success:  
cooperation favors matching actions, while complementary coordination favors complementary but distinct actions.

## Summary

| Type | Best outcome | Risk/problem | Role of norms |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Correlative coordination | Matching behaviors | Miscoordination if individuals choose differently | Establish expectations for matching behaviors |
| Cooperation (a type of correlative coordination) | Mutual cooperation (matching behaviors) | Temptation to defect for personal gain | Suppress defection, reinforce cooperation |
| Complementary coordination | Complementary but different behaviors | Confusion over role assignment | Establish who performs which complementary role |
