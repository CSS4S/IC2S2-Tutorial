# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

These are the course notes and manual for the Agent-based Modeling for Sustainability, the second course in the Computational Social Science for Sustainability (CSS4S) series at the [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/).

The course and the [`socmod`](https://css4s.github.io/socmod) library are under active development. If you have suggestions, questions, want to report typos, etc., please help me out and [open an issue](https://github.com/CSS4S/notes/issues) on the repo's GitHub page.

This online book is divided in two parts:

1.  Notes on the theory and application of agent-based modeling to promoting the social diffusion of sustainable practices through social learning and social influence. Continue on to the [Introduction](intro.qmd) to read the Notes.
2.  [Technical manual](manual.qmd) that reviews the skills and techniques needed to develop agent-based models for sustainability and present the results in a scientific article.

Please select a chapter from the list to the left or [continue to the Introduction](intro.qmd).
