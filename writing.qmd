# Writing and project development

It is a great feeling to close out one stage of a research project by writing in
careful detail what we found, how we found it, and why it matters. But one of
the most overwhelming challenges for me as a researcher, and I believe many
others, is to write linear, logical, and likable research papers. One secret
I've learned only recently is that the "writing" starts at the very beginning as
one is developing a new project. This doesn't mean that the ideas, motivations,
and plan for research projects don't change as the project goes from idea to
finished product. But there must be sufficient justification and logic
underlying a project's motivation and implementation plan. For a while I've been
familiar with the saying "great writing means great editing", but until recently
I didn't understand that that means one must constantly be producing content
(code or prose, figures, tables, etc.) and revising, reworking, recombining, and
reevaluating our research products.

Good scientific writing contextualizes our research questions and goals by
introducing existing problems and solutions in a linear, logical way. The
methods, results, and analyses are presented in sufficient detail so the reader
can re-produce the model and analysis. Scientific results themselves must be
contextualized them in terms of our research questions and explains *why* the
model outcomes emerged as they did. Good writing finishes with a review of the
findings, the model or methods that produced them, the research questions that
motivated the study, the impact of the findings for the research questions and
more broadly for social behavior/sustainability, for social behavioral sciences,
and even for our general understanding of the universe, as appropriate.

Scientific papers share a structure that we will use as a template so one need
not start from scratch, called the IMAD (or IMRaD) structure. These acronyms
stand for the major section headings of research papers corresponding to the
major logical divisions of the content. IMAD stands for Introduction, Model,
Analysis, and Discussion, and IMRaD stands for *Introduction*, *Methods*,
*Results*, *a*nd *Discussion*.

Below is a potentially useful strategy for initiating a new article on a
computational model of social behavior. The cheat sheet guide in
@fig-paper-sections serves as a checklist and template for the abstract and each
section. Follow these guidelines to take the guesswork out of article
development and stay focused on the most important creative work: developing a
computational analysis of an important social behavior system important for
promoting sustainability, and communicating it clearly to your audience to
maximize the impact of your work.

## Steps to an article

You can follow this guide as a checklist to planning, developing, and publishing
scientific or policy articles that harness computational models of social
behavior, perhaps transferable to related computational studies:

1.  Write the very first "draft" of the paper in the form of an *Abstract +
    Outline*. The abstract should be about 200 words or less. The Outline should
    be divided into the major IMAD/IMRaD sections. See @fig-paper-sections for a
    summary.
2.  Develop a *model prototype*, i.e., a first draft of software implementation.
    Then perform a *preliminary analysis*, i.e., some minimal visualization
    comparing outcomes over a set of systematically varied model parameters,
    i.e., input explanatory variables that affect social diffusion of
    adaptations or other emergent social phenomena.
3.  Write a complete first draft of the paper that includes about one paragraph
    for every bullet point in @fig-paper-sections. The bullet points are
    intentionally unordered: in this framework, the presentation order of
    information is flexible and should be tailored specifically for each
    project. The Model section should contain tables that summarize model
    parameters and output measures, and describe the computational experiment
    design. The Analysis section should be based on the preliminary analysis,
    with clearly annotated scientific figures and minimal captions for each
    figure.
4.  Revise paper over several readings and small, iterative changes. Experiment
    with alternative visualizations. Ensure all technical terms are introduced
    first as prose in the Introduction, then formally in the Model section. Make
    sure the system is specified in sufficient detail in the Introduction so the
    sustainability context is clear for the reader. Make sure the reader could
    implement the model on their own if all they did was read the Model section.
5.  Publish the paper. Before sending a journal article to a journal, post code
    to GitHub. Write a README.md to be displayed to visitors to your GitHub
    project repo. The README can serve to connect the paper's presentation of
    the model and analysis with the code that implemented the model analysis. If
    you need to anonymize your repository, for example to anonymize a paper
    submission, try the free tool [Anonymous
    Github](https://anonymous.4open.science/). For publishing in journals,
    [prepare a cover
    letter](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+write+a+journal+cover+letter&rlz=1C5GCEM_en&oq=how+to+write+a+journal+cover+letter&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIGCAUQRRhAMgYIBhBFGEAyBggHEEUYQNIBCDM0MDdqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
    that explains to the editors what the paper says, why it is a good fit for
    the journal, and suggest potential reviewers.

## Appendix

Below we include the CSS4S authorship and acknowledgement policy. One thing I
love about this work is working with other scientists. In situations where work
is co-produced, it's important to understand how our work will be recognized
either in authorship or other explicit acknowledgement in published materials.
In general my colleagues and I operate on the following authorship and
acknowledgement policy. It states "two hours contributing to discussions" or
other efforts are sufficient for authorship, plus editing of the final draft
before submission. This is based on participation in roughly two brainstorming
sessions.

### Authorship and Acknowledgement Policy

For collaborative projects such as course notes, preprints, or research papers,
authorship is offered to all participants who spend at least two hours
contributing to discussions about the paper or chapter, and who review or edit
at least one paragraph of the final submission. Students, research assistants,
and teaching assistants who meet these criteria will be listed as co-authors or
credited appropriately. For any formal book or published work developed from
these materials, authorship will be limited to those who contribute
substantially to the conception, writing, and organization of the book as a
whole. Other contributors to related projects, class notes, or supporting
materials may be recognized in the acknowledgments.
