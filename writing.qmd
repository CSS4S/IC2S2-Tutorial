# Writing


One of the most overwhelming challenges for me as a researcher is writing
research papers. I've been lucky to learn from excellent teachers and currently
have a network of mentors I can turn to for help. Still, writing is an
inherently solitary endeavor that is in many ways an exploration, the building
of a map of information. When we present our scientific work, much of 
the information already exists in the form of previous work on which we build.
In terms of information volume, the work we present in scientific papers 
is relatively miniscule compared to the
vast wealth of science amassed up to today. However, our work we want to write
is new to the world, including ourselves even though we created it. This means
that we need to take special care to explain 

Good
scientific writing (1) reviews previous work in the context of our project goals; 
(2) notes the location of some dark, foggy corners of our current understanding to
motivate new work we intend to present to the reader; (3) presents the model
in sufficient detail so the reader can re-produce the model and analysis; (4) 
presents results by contextualizing them in terms of our research questions 
and explains _why_ the model outcomes emerged as they did; and finally, (5)
reviews the findings, the model that produced them, the research questions that
motivated the model, the impact of the findings for the research questions and
more broadly for social behavior/sustainability, for social behavioral sciences,
and even for our general understanding of the universe, as appropriate. 

Scientific papers share a structure that we will use as a template so one need not
start from scratch. The structure is known as either the IMAD or IMRaD
structure, which stands for the major section headings of the papers
indicating the major logical divisions of the presentation of social behavior
modeling studies: either the Introduction, Model, Analysis, Discussion structure
or the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion structure. 

More details on all this to come in the next few weeks.
