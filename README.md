This repository is the Quarto Book of notes for my [IC2S2 2025 Tutorial](https://www.ic2s2-2025.org/tutorials/#computational-social-science-for-sustainability). 

It is a mash-up of notes from two courses I taught last academic year, *Computational Social Science for Sustainability* and *Agent-based Modeling for Sustainability*. If you notice any copy-paste errors that belie this fact, or have any other feedback, ideas, comments, critiques, etc., please [open an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/CSS4S/IC2S2-Tutorial/issues/new). Thanks in advance.
