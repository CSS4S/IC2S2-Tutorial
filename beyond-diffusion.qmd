# Beyond diffusion 


Choosing what to do is not just defined by payoffs, social structure and
a single social learning strategy, as we modeled it in the previous chapters on
diffusion. In this part of the notes we expand the scope
of our social behavior theory to include more features: opinions and polarization, uncertainty and its effect on social learning,
and a more nuanced cognitive learning model called *reinforcement learning*. 

**Opinions** (aka **beliefs**) shape our expectations about the benefits of 
different behaviors and our openness to learn from others, which in some
contexts depends on how similar interaction partners are to one another.

**Environmental uncertainty can reduce, remove, or even reverse the benefits of
social learning if environmental variability is unpredictable. 
If the environment is unpredictable, socially-learned information 
could become outdated before it is learned, meaning a previously 
adaptive or sustainable behavior could have become maladptive or unsustainable
with the passing of time. For example, monocrop agriculture that tills the
ground every season may be less economical and sustainable than it once was
given that climate catastrophes occur more frequently, but with unpredictable
timing. 

Models that flexibly integrate information
to update behavioral outcome expectations that guide behavior are called
*reinforcement learning* models. We humans have
an extensive repertoire of *genetic* cognitive adaptations for dealing with 
this sort of uncertainty. We 
update our expectations behavioral benefits based on the stream of information
we experience in the form of learning from others while
accounting for discrepencies between their personal contexts and ours [@Witt2024].
Humans are no slaves to socially-learned information, of course, so these models get us one step closer to more realistic social learning.
