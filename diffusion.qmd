# Diffusion

<br>

In the context of sustainability and climate adaptation, behavior change often depends not only on individual decisions but also on social networks that constrain who interacts with whom, and whether individuals use adaptive social learning to choose behaviors, as opposed to just copying randomly. When individuals use adaptive social learning to choose between behaviors, this provides the selection mechanism that generates cultural evolution.

## Introduction

The puzzles of diffusion and belief change provide resistance to spreading sustainable practices unless they are addressed. Today a Cambrian explosion in green tech startups and new products and data analytics continues continues. Ancient Indigenous practices have helped humans adapt to climate change for generations upon generations. Unfortunately these practices are ignored in favor of expensive, poorly tested, maladaptive "grey infrastructure", like sea walls that act more like dams once breached and soak up humanitarian aid like a money sponge. Similarly, In this chapter we build up models of social diffusion via social learning, starting from a minimal specification of how social interaction and learning work. Specifically, we start with the *Unconstrained Contagion* model of stochastic transmission in a very large population, so new learners of sustainable practices are always available. In this chapter we only consider behaviors that individuals do alone gain benefit. However, the material in this chapter provides the foundation for the next two chapters. 

In the next two chapters, we extend the models developed here to understand the diffusion of behaviors that yield benefits or payoffs only in *coordination* with others doing either *cooperative* (i.e., the same) or *complementary* (i.e., different) behaviors.  Promoting the diffusion of cooperation could improve the success rate of natural resource conservation interventions, such as sustainable groundwater usage cooperation to avoid exhausting underground aquifers that people and farms depend on. In the second chapter, we use leader-follower decisions between men and women as a model for how negative social judgements against men who follow women could support despite progress towards gender pay equity, more maternal leave, and other material improvements. 

### Overview

In this chapter we start building our framework for social diffusion, represented by mechanistic mathematical and software models of social transmission and learning. We begin with a simple model of a chain of unconstrained social transmission starting from a single teacher, with no limit on how many people might learn from teachers of teachers of teachers, and so on. We also assume behaviors do not require coordination with others, and so the benefit of doing a behavior is independent of the number of people doing the behavior. I show how we can use discrete-time difference equations, continuous-time differential equations, or agent-based simulation to arrive at the same conclusion: prevalence increases exponentially over time under these assumption. We tag this the *Going Viral* model as it could represent the "going viral" stage of an emerging trend when there are many potential new adopters and few current adopters [@Rogers2003;@Smaldino2023_Ch4Contagion].

To understand how real-world constraints affect diffusion, we scaffold from this unconstrained *Going Viral* model, adding constraints one at a time and observing their effects.  First is the constraint of *finite populations* in the section *Bounded Virality* below. Next is the *Viral Friends* section where we consider the effect of interaction structure, which could be represented by homophily or a social network, for example. Finally,
adaptive social learning constrains diffusion to cultural evolutionary dynamics, presented in the section *Guided Virality*. 

One side effect of this organization is that cultural evolution is revealed as  diffusion process. Cultural evolution is enabled and driven by adaptive social learning, which provides selection pressure on behaviors [@@Richerson2020]. *Behavior* is the analogue of *phenotype* in genetic evolution; *adaptive social learning* is the analogue of *preferential mating* in genetic evolution [@CavalliFeldman1981;@Boyd1995;@BoydRicherson2005]. In both cases, the *behavioral gambit* and *phenotypic gambit* are common names for the modeling assumption that knowledge of how to do a behavior, or the genetic encoding for the pheotype, are faithfully transmitted. Furthermore, this *gambit* assumes that once an individual knows how to do a behavior, they perform it perfectly, or the individual's genotype is perfectly expressed in the phenotype. A final assumption embedded in this gambit is a one-to-one correspondence between knowledge/genetics and behavior/phenotype. 

In *adaptive social learning*, model individuals prefer learning from others who are more successful, for example, or perhaps prefer adopting behaviors practiced by a greater number of their social partners [@Laland2004;@Kendal2018;@Toyokawa2019]. If individual psychology is such that more successful individuals are more likely to be chosen as teachers, this is called *success-biased learning*. When more prevalent behaviors are preferentially learned, this is *frequency-biased learning*. Keep in mind that these adaptive learning strategies are to cultural evolution what
preferential mating is to genetic evolution: adaptive social learning induces
evolutionary diffusion dynamics. 

In the two chapters following this one we will harness cultural evolution to
understand how norms of cooperation and gender equity in leadership could evolve to sticky equilibria that may take special efforts to deconstruct, even in idealized simulations. These models are the final scaffold on the diffusion model presented here. We represent these coordination problems in sustainability in terms of *evolutionary game theory*. 

### Relation to social influence and belief/opinion change

Social influence dynamics of beliefs or opinions [@Blau1974;@DeGroot1974;@Lorenz2007;@Flache2011;@Turner2018;@Galesic2021] are
considered as a different class of models in this framework since the thing being transmitted is *latent*, i.e., not directly observable. In these cases, we can only observe *behaviors* 
that either report or belie latent psychological beliefs or opinions. I develop social influence
models in terms of our framework later in these notes.

<!-- - The first constraint to social -->
<!-- transmission: a finite population of *teachers* and *learners*, our general -->
<!-- purpose names for the person from whom social information originates and to whom -->
<!-- it goes, respectively. -->

<!-- - The second constraint we consider is when adaptive social learning guides -->
<!--   social transmission. Under the first and primary form of adaptive social -->
<!--   learning we consider, *success-biased* social learning, teachers are selected -->
<!--   at random from an individual's neighbors, weighted by each neighbor's -->
<!--   *fitness*, with the learner included as a "neighbor", i.e., potential teacher, -->
<!--   so that beneficial behaviors are preferentially maintained under -->
<!--   success-biased learning. *Frequency-biased* learning is another adaptive -->
<!--   strategy sometimes observed in modern and archeological evidence which we -->
<!--   demonstrate, but focus on less throughout the course material, using -->
<!--   success-biased learning as the default to induce evolutionary dynamics, -->
<!--   explained in more detail below. -->

<!-- - The third and final constraint is on the structure of social interactions, -->
<!--   represented by the system's *social network*. We'll consider three types of -->
<!--   social network models, each with stylized real-world features: first are regular -->
<!--   networks, which are lattices like a two-dimensional spatial grid that can be -->
<!--   used to model cooperation in natural resource conservation, for example. -->
<!--   Second, we use random networks to represent irregularities in social network -->
<!--   structures, which can promote or inhibit the success of educational -->
<!--   behavior-change interventions. Third, we consider a more specific class of -->
<!--   random network, *asymmetric homophily* networks, in which different groups -->
<!--   have different tendencies to interact more frequently with others from within -->
<!--   their own group compared to between groups. These can be used to generate -->
<!--   *core-periphery* social networks where the *core* group is the most connected both -->
<!--   within its own group and between itself and the *peripheral* groups are only -->
<!--   loosely connected within themselves and between other groups. -->


<!-- ## Representing interventions as math and code -->


<!-- - Recall that a _sustainability intervention_ is an effort to promote some -->
<!--   sustainable behavior or set of behaviors through education, training, or other -->
<!--   means. This framing is a consequence of our guiding motivation to identify -->
<!--   real-world mechanisms to harness in promoting sustainable practices conforming -->
<!--   to one or more of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. The -->
<!--   models and conclusions are general, however, since this framing is only used -->
<!--   for efficient development and comprehension of the computational findings. -->
<!-- - To model the diffusion of a sustainable practice we separate the social world -->
<!--   and social processes into distinct, interacting parts. We model social -->
<!--   dynamics with a general framework that is systematically filled out, and on -->
<!--   which the `socmod` social behavior modeling library is based. (Explain the -->
<!--   general abstract model...previews the subsection below) -->
<!-- - Any intervention must decide who should be the first people to receive  -->
<!--   instruction on how to do some adaptive, sustainable behavior practice, including how -->
<!--   beneficial an adaptation is. This subset of the population is called the *seed -->
<!--   set*. One popular approach to optimizing interventions is the *seeding -->
<!--   strategy* used to intelligently select which indivuals will comprise the seed -->
<!--   set. For example, the *friendship nomination* strategy led to more effective -->
<!--   diffusion of public health information compared to random seeding across about -->
<!--   one hundred villages in rural Honduras [@Airoldi2024]. In -->
<!--   friendship nomination, $N_S$ seed members are chosen by selecting one  -->
<!--   acquaintance of $N_S$ randomly-selected individuals, as opposed to the random -->
<!--   strategy being just selecting $N_S$ seeds at random directly. In another -->
<!--   example, @Efferson2020 studied simulations of a public health intervention to -->
<!--   help end female genital cutting in Sudan, inspired by field studies of -->
<!--   real-world interventions [@Vogt2016]. -->
<!-- - We use our models to calculate the *prevalence dynamics* and *outcome -->
<!--   measures* both within and across simulation trials. *Prevalence dynamics*  -->


<!-- ### The general diffusion model -->

<!-- 1. **Population and social network structure:** who interacts with whom. -->
<!-- 1. **Social transmission/learning:** how agents learn from others and adopt -->
<!--    behaviors. -->
<!-- 1. **Equilibrium/stopping conditions:** stop the simulation at equilibrium -->

<!-- This flexible framework will carry through the rest of the course. In the next section, we extend this model to explore how homophily, asymmetry, and structural inequality affect adaptation outcomes. -->

<!-- ### Techniques for creating simulations from box-and-arrow diagrams -->

<!-- Box and arrow diagrams are a great start, but we'll need either mathematics or -->
<!-- simulation to help us make predictions about how different social factors, -->
<!-- processes, and behaviors affect long-term outcomes in terms of the adoption -->
<!-- prevalence of sustainable practices. -->

<!-- ### Discrete- and continuous-time formalism -->

<!-- Mathematics helps us be specific in a way prose cannot. A mathematical -->
<!-- *formalism* is a system of symbols, relationships, and equations that specify -->
<!-- a model of a real-world system. In the social diffusion of sustainable practices,  -->
<!-- we develop mathematical symbols and  -->
<!-- equations that describe how the *prevalence* of different behaviors changes over -->
<!-- time. We will need to describe how likely it is that one person learns a -->
<!-- behavior from another person, and how likely it is for any one person to stop -->
<!-- doing the sustainable behavior, reverting to some exhaustive behavior.  -->

<!-- {{< include tables/formal-symbology.html >}} -->


<!-- ### Simulation -->

<!-- Agent-based models help us represent complexity by formalizing how _cognition_ and _social structure_ interact. Each component is modeled separately. _Cognition_ refers to the processes agents use to evaluate and adopt behaviors—drawing on existing knowledge, experience, and social feedback. _Social structure_ refers to constraints on who interacts with whom, shaped by acquaintanceship, geography, institutions, and chance. We model social structure as a _network_: a graph where _nodes_ represent individuals and _edges_ represent relationships through which information or influence can flow. -->

<!-- We design our simulations to evaluate different intervention strategies based on cognitive factors we deem most important, with social structure that is "good enough" for representing a real-world system.   by vary which agents start with a given behavior or belief, a process often called _seeding_. For example, in a diffusion model, we might seed a behavior with the most connected individuals, a randomly selected group, or individuals located in a particular community. These differences allow us to explore how network structure interacts with initial conditions to shape diffusion outcomes—helping us identify strategies that are more robust, equitable, or efficient. -->

### Going viral: unconstrained contagion


{{< include Include/unconstrained-contagion.qmd >}}


### Bounded virality: finite population size

- Now at most $N$ agents can adopt the sustainable practice, so marginal
  adoption tapers off over time as more nearly everyone adopts the sustainable
  practice.
- One of the best-known approaches to modeling social diffusion is the
  *contagion* model of transmission, where behaviors are transmitted
  probabilistically as if they were a disease being transmitted interpersonally.
  When people interact in this model, one learns from the other. If the learner
  practes the Exhaust behavior, $E$, and observes or is instructed by a teacher
  who practices the Sustain behavior, $S$, then there is a probability $\alpha$
  that the learner adopts (i.e., begins doing) $S$. $\alpha$ is therefore called
  the *adoption rate*.

### Viral friends: social network constraints on diffusion 


#### The good and the bad of social structure and long-range ties


#### Homophily: choice and induced 

**Homophily** is the tendency for similar individuals to associate. We distinguish two forms:

-   **Choice homophily**, where individuals actively prefer similar partners;
-   **Induced homophily**, where external constraints (e.g., institutions, geography) create segregation even without conscious preference.

Two empirical illustrations:

-   An analysis of remote-work-eligible occupations shows clustering by education, income, and race.
-   A study of minority students in a mostly white MBA program finds that homophily can foster solidarity and resilience.

These examples show that homophily can inhibit or support adaptation, depending on the context.

We also discuss experimental results from Centola (2010, 2011), which show that homophilous networks can outperform random ones in spreading health behaviors—especially when reinforcement and social learning are important.

#### Asymmetric homophily and diffusion

In some cases, homophily is **asymmetric**. One group (often the minority) is more exposed to the other than vice versa. In the "Minority Incubator, Majority Reservoir" model, this asymmetry allows minority-originating adaptations to diffuse outward more effectively.

This structural asymmetry isn’t necessarily intentional—it can emerge from how connections are formed. Yet it has real implications for diffusion, visibility, and adaptation speed.

#### Core-periphery structure

In a **core-periphery** network, a dense core of well-connected individuals is surrounded by a sparsely connected periphery. This structure supports fast diffusion through the core but may limit peripheral influence.

The South Pacific Island case provides an example: core-periphery organization enabled stable adaptation strategies under conditions of uncertainty and risk. These designs may emerge deliberately or organically.

#### When ties break: cumulative loss

To illustrate the consequences of broken connections, we turn to Henrich’s study of tool diversity in Oceania. When long-range maritime ties between islands broke down, isolated communities lost complex technologies.

This example highlights how network fragmentation can halt or reverse cumulative cultural evolution—a key dynamic in adaptation and innovation.

### Guided virality: cultural evolution via social learning

- Culture truly evolves when people preferentially select teachers who seem
  more successful than alternatives or are better socially connected, 
  or when people preferentially adopt behaviors that seem to
  be practiced more widely than others, or any similar social learning strategy.
  Being able to flexibly probe, sample, and integrate different sources of social and
  asocial information is a fundamental part of what it means to be human
  [@Witt2024]. Over time, stable cultural practices become established as
  various social learning strategies exercised flexibly by individuals weed out 
  less desirable Behavioral norms serve as heuristics for
  individual decision-making contingencies, such as how much to share 
  of a publicly-visible and shareable gift, or gendered division of labor from
  the relatively harmless decision of which gender leads in a social partner
  dance to who is responsible for more household chores and has freer access to
  liquid household resources or credit [@OConnor2019]. 
  We know because different cultures have different norms encoding different
  motivations for behavior in economic decisions and reasoning in general,
  self-concept, and reasoning in general, that systematically affect behavior in
  similar ways within, but not between, cultures in general [@Henrich2010].
- Of the many foundations of humanity is the unrivaled capacity to learn from
  others, with adaptations that help us decide from whom to learn, such as
  preferentially from the most apparently fit social network neighbors, or what
  features of a behavior are most desirable, such as a high prevalence of
  behavioral adoption. 
- Because of the non-linear nature of either form of adaptive social learning,
  attaining *closed-form* solutions to the formal equations is much more
  difficult and therefore more the domain of matematical biology than
  computational social science. Still, the basic predictions with some key
  simplifying, asymptotic assumptions are accessible to understand, with the
  derivations comprehensible in broad strokes.
- Because formal methods become increasingly restrictive as social behavior
  complexity is increased, simulation becomes more important. At this stage,
  simulation becomes much more accessible to many more social scientists. This
  becomes even more true as we go beyond the well-mixed assumption necessary for
  formal calculations in unconstrained or constrained contagion, and into 
  developing computational models of behavior diffusion where interaction
  structure is represented by a social network.
