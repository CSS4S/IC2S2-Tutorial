# Diffusion

In the context of sustainability and climate adaptation, behavior change often depends not only on individual decisions but also on the social networks through which information and behaviors spread. This chapter examines how the structure of social networks influences the diffusion of adaptations—behaviors or practices that help people adjust to new risks or environmental conditions.

## Primer on interventions (Lecture 3 10 minutes, Lecture 4 review 5 minutes)


- Recall that a _sustainability intervention_ is an effort to promote some sustainable behavior or set of behaviors through education, training, or other means.
- In order to simulate interventions, we must develop a sub-model for interventions, starting with classification. 
  - Our models of interventions will not be totally disconnected from models of the social systems themselves. Intervention models will specify the expected mode of transmission hypothesized to be most important for the design of the intervention.
  - Intervention models should specify the outcome variable. For now, we will use the simplest version of outcomes included by default in `socmod` agent-based model output.

## Comparing seeding strategies for interventions (Lecture 3, April 7, 2025)

### Motivation (10 minutes)

We begin with a concrete example: health behavior interventions in rural Honduran villages. In a study by Aral and Christakis, the researchers used detailed network data to test whether targeting well-connected individuals could increase the spread of health-promoting behaviors. The intervention succeeded not because it directly reached everyone, but because the network structure amplified its effects.

This example also serves as the foundation for an agent-based modeling assignment in which we will explain how _computational experiments_ help us understand and predict the effect of different seeding and other intervention strategies.

We will close by contrasting seeding strategies that ignore social structure, as in the @Airaldi2024 work reviewed above, with those that leverage social structure.

### Network models and structure (10–25 minutes)

To understand why structure matters, we explore a series of increasingly complex network models. We begin with **deterministic models**:

-   **Ring networks**, where each node is connected to a fixed number of neighbors.
-   **Complete networks**, where every node is connected to every other node.

These help us isolate basic features like clustering and distance. We then turn to **stochastic models**:

-   **Erdős–Rényi random networks**, where links are created with fixed probability.
-   **Watts–Strogatz small-world networks**, which combine high local clustering with occasional long-range ties.

The small-world model captures key features of real-world social networks: short average path lengths and local clustering. Examples from the original Watts and Strogatz paper—such as the U.S. power grid and the C. elegans neural network—illustrate how widespread these features are.

An unintuitive feature of many social networks is the **friendship paradox**: on average, your friends have more friends than you do. This emerges because well-connected individuals are more likely to appear in others’ networks. It affects who sees new behaviors early, who is most influential, and how we interpret network data. We include a visualization to illustrate this dynamic and emphasize the importance of precise language.

### From structure to simulation (20 minutes)

We now introduce the agent-based model that underlies both the simulations in this chapter and the students’ problem set. This is the final component of Lecture 1. 

<!-- Agent-based models are a method for dealing with complexity by formalizing how _cognition_ and _social structure_ affect one another, with cognition and social structure each defined represented separately. _Cognition_ refers to adaptations for using environmental information to guide behavior: this includes knowledge of _how_ to do things and how to _learn_ to do new things. _Social structure_ refers to the fact that who interacts with whom is constrained by existing acquaintances, location, happenstance, and other factors. In modeling social behavior we represent the sum total of these factors as a _social network_, an instance of a mathematical _graph_ defined by graph nodes (aka _vertices_) represent people and graph edges that indicate some kind of relationship between two people when an edge connects them.  -->

Agent-based models help us represent complexity by formalizing how _cognition_ and _social structure_ interact. Each component is modeled separately. _Cognition_ refers to the processes agents use to evaluate and adopt behaviors—drawing on existing knowledge, experience, and social feedback. _Social structure_ refers to constraints on who interacts with whom, shaped by acquaintanceship, geography, institutions, and chance. We model social structure as a _network_: a graph where _nodes_ represent individuals and _edges_ represent relationships through which information or influence can flow.

We design our simulations to evaluate different intervention strategies based on cognitive factors we deem most important, with social structure that is "good enough" for representing a real-world system.   by vary which agents start with a given behavior or belief, a process often called _seeding_. For example, in a diffusion model, we might seed a behavior with the most connected individuals, a randomly selected group, or individuals located in a particular community. These differences allow us to explore how network structure interacts with initial conditions to shape diffusion outcomes—helping us identify strategies that are more robust, equitable, or efficient.

1.  **Cognition**: how agents evaluate new behaviors;
2.  **Social behavior**: how agents learn from others and adopt behaviors;
3.  **Network structure**: who interacts with whom.

These components are modular, allowing us to isolate the effects of structure while holding behavior constant.

This flexible framework will carry through the rest of the course. In the next section, we extend this model to explore how homophily, asymmetry, and structural inequality affect adaptation outcomes.

## Network structure patterns that shape and constrain adaptation

### Extending the model (10 minutes)

Building on the framework above, we now incorporate more realistic structures: **homophily** and **core-periphery organization**. These patterns are common in social systems and can shape diffusion outcomes in ways that are not obvious.

### Homophily: choice and induced (10 minutes)

**Homophily** is the tendency for similar individuals to associate. We distinguish two forms:

-   **Choice homophily**, where individuals actively prefer similar partners;
-   **Induced homophily**, where external constraints (e.g., institutions, geography) create segregation even without conscious preference.

Students will be asked to generate their own examples in class or in discussion sections. Two empirical illustrations:

-   An analysis of remote-work-eligible occupations shows clustering by education, income, and race.
-   A study of minority students in a mostly white MBA program finds that homophily can foster solidarity and resilience.

\![Placeholder: Plot that I created based on that data. \]

These examples show that homophily can inhibit or support adaptation, depending on the context.

We also discuss experimental results from Centola (2010, 2011), which show that homophilous networks can outperform random ones in spreading health behaviors—especially when reinforcement and social learning are important.

### Asymmetric homophily and diffusion (10 minutes)

In some cases, homophily is **asymmetric**. One group (often the minority) is more exposed to the other than vice versa. In the "Minority Incubator, Majority Reservoir" model, this asymmetry allows minority-originating adaptations to diffuse outward more effectively.

This structural asymmetry isn’t necessarily intentional—it can emerge from how connections are formed. Yet it has real implications for diffusion, visibility, and adaptation speed.

### Core-periphery structure (10 minutes)

In a **core-periphery** network, a dense core of well-connected individuals is surrounded by a sparsely connected periphery. This structure supports fast diffusion through the core but may limit peripheral influence.

The South Pacific Island case provides an example: core-periphery organization enabled stable adaptation strategies under conditions of uncertainty and risk. These designs may emerge deliberately or organically.

### When ties break: cumulative loss (5 minutes)

To illustrate the consequences of broken connections, we turn to Henrich’s study of tool diversity in Oceania. When long-range maritime ties between islands broke down, isolated communities lost complex technologies.

This example highlights how network fragmentation can halt or reverse cumulative cultural evolution—a key dynamic in adaptation and innovation.

### Modeling implications (5 minutes)

Using the same agent-based model, we simulate diffusion on homophilous and core-periphery networks. Holding cognition and social behavior constant, we find:

-   Some structures accelerate diffusion;
-   Some amplify inequality in who adopts adaptations;
-   Some slow or block spread entirely.

These outcomes underscore the importance of network design in policy, development, and sustainability work.

### Conclusion and transition (5 minutes)

Social networks don’t just transmit information—they shape who hears what, when, and from whom. Homophily and core-periphery structures are not marginal—they are central to how behaviors spread, how inequality persists, and how sustainability strategies succeed or fail.

In the next chapter and lecture, we extend this framework to include **identity**, **polarization**, and the role of **group norms**. These additional dynamics interact with the structures introduced here—and complicate efforts to promote coordination, learning, or fairness across diverse populations.
