# Diffusion

From whom and how we learn are essential components in explaining the puzzles of
diffusion and belief change that underlie the transition to more sustainable
practices. In this section we will introduce models of social behavior across
different agent-based model configurations. The first chapter in this section
introduces a general model of the diffusion of adaptations. Next, we show how
models of cooperation can help us understand and predict outcomes in
environmental management problems that require stakeholders to do the same
behavior, using cooperation with groundwater usage limit laws within a water
district as a prototypical example. Next we will present a related behavioral
puzzle, that of why certain social norms like gender norms generate inequity and
inequality, and point to how modeling social behavior can help us identify
potential strategies for reaching more equitable equilibriums. 

In the context of sustainability and climate adaptation, behavior change often depends not only on individual decisions but also on the social networks through which information and behaviors spread. This chapter examines how the structure of social networks influences the diffusion of adaptations—behaviors or practices that help people adjust to new risks or environmental conditions.

In this chapter we start building a theory of social diffusion represented 
by mechanistic models of social transmission and learning. We begin with a
simple model of a chain of unconstrained social transmission starting from a
single teacher, with no limit on how many people might learn from teachers of
teachers of teachers, and so on. We also assume behaviors do not require
coordination with others, and so the benefit of doing a behavior is independent
of the number of people doing the behavior. I show how we can use
discrete-time difference
equations, continuous-time differential equations, or agent-based simulation 
to arrive at the same conclusion: prevalence increases exponentially over time
under these assumptions, akin to the "going viral" stage of an emerging trend,
or what Roger's might identify as the stage when tight-knit trend followers
quickly adopt fashionable new practices [@Rogers2003;@Smaldino2023_Ch4Contagion]

- The first constraint to social
transmission: a finite population of *teachers* and *learners*, our general
purpose names for the person from whom social information originates and to whom
it goes, respectively.

- The second constraint we consider is when adaptive social learning guides
  social transmission. Under the first and primary form of adaptive social
  learning we consider, *success-biased* social learning, teachers are selected
  at random from an individual's neighbors, weighted by each neighbor's
  *fitness*, with the learner included as a "neighbor", i.e., potential teacher,
  so that beneficial behaviors are preferentially maintained under
  success-biased learning. *Frequency-biased* learning is another adaptive
  strategy sometimes observed in modern and archeological evidence which we
  demonstrate, but focus on less throughout the course material, using
  success-biased learning as the default to induce evolutionary dynamics,
  explained in more detail below.

- The third and final constraint is on the structure of social interactions,
  represented by the system's *social network*. We'll consider three types of
  social network models, each with stylized real-world features: first are regular
  networks, which are lattices like a two-dimensional spatial grid that can be
  used to model cooperation in natural resource conservation, for example.
  Second, we use random networks to represent irregularities in social network
  structures, which can promote or inhibit the success of educational
  behavior-change interventions. Third, we consider a more specific class of
  random network, *asymmetric homophily* networks, in which different groups
  have different tendencies to interact more frequently with others from within
  their own group compared to between groups. These can be used to generate
  *core-periphery* social networks where the *core* group is the most connected both
  within its own group and between itself and the *peripheral* groups are only
  loosely connected within themselves and between other groups.


## Representing interventions as math and code


- Recall that a _sustainability intervention_ is an effort to promote some
  sustainable behavior or set of behaviors through education, training, or other
  means. This framing is a consequence of our guiding motivation to identify
  real-world mechanisms to harness in promoting sustainable practices conforming
  to one or more of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. The
  models and conclusions are general, however, since this framing is only used
  for efficient development and comprehension of the computational findings.
- To model the diffusion of a sustainable practice we separate the social world
  and social processes into distinct, interacting parts. We model social
  dynamics with a general framework that is systematically filled out, and on
  which the `socmod` social behavior modeling library is based. (Explain the
  general abstract model...previews the subsection below)
- Any intervention must decide who should be the first people to receive 
  instruction on how to do some adaptive, sustainable behavior practice, including how
  beneficial an adaptation is. This subset of the population is called the *seed
  set*. One popular approach to optimizing interventions is the *seeding
  strategy* used to intelligently select which indivuals will comprise the seed
  set. For example, the *friendship nomination* strategy led to more effective
  diffusion of public health information compared to random seeding across about
  one hundred villages in rural Honduras [@Airoldi2024]. In
  friendship nomination, $N_S$ seed members are chosen by selecting one 
  acquaintance of $N_S$ randomly-selected individuals, as opposed to the random
  strategy being just selecting $N_S$ seeds at random directly. In another
  example, @Efferson2020 studied simulations of a public health intervention to
  help end female genital cutting in Sudan, inspired by field studies of
  real-world interventions [@Vogt2016].
- We use our models to calculate the *prevalence dynamics* and *outcome
  measures* both within and across simulation trials. *Prevalence dynamics* 


### The general diffusion model

1. **Population and social network structure:** who interacts with whom.
1. **Social transmission/learning:** how agents learn from others and adopt
   behaviors.
1. **Equilibrium/stopping conditions:** stop the simulation at equilibrium

This flexible framework will carry through the rest of the course. In the next section, we extend this model to explore how homophily, asymmetry, and structural inequality affect adaptation outcomes.

### Techniques for creating simulations from box-and-arrow diagrams

Box and arrow diagrams are a great start, but we'll need either mathematics or
simulation to help us make predictions about how different social factors,
processes, and behaviors affect long-term outcomes in terms of the adoption
prevalence of sustainable practices.

### Discrete- and continuous-time formalism

Mathematics helps us be specific in a way prose cannot. A mathematical
*formalism* is a system of symbols, relationships, and equations that specify
a model of a real-world system. In the social diffusion of sustainable practices, 
we develop mathematical symbols and 
equations that describe how the *prevalence* of different behaviors changes over
time. We will need to describe how likely it is that one person learns a
behavior from another person, and how likely it is for any one person to stop
doing the sustainable behavior, reverting to some exhaustive behavior. 

{{< include tables/formal-symbology.html >}}


### Simulation

Agent-based models help us represent complexity by formalizing how _cognition_ and _social structure_ interact. Each component is modeled separately. _Cognition_ refers to the processes agents use to evaluate and adopt behaviors—drawing on existing knowledge, experience, and social feedback. _Social structure_ refers to constraints on who interacts with whom, shaped by acquaintanceship, geography, institutions, and chance. We model social structure as a _network_: a graph where _nodes_ represent individuals and _edges_ represent relationships through which information or influence can flow.

We design our simulations to evaluate different intervention strategies based on cognitive factors we deem most important, with social structure that is "good enough" for representing a real-world system.   by vary which agents start with a given behavior or belief, a process often called _seeding_. For example, in a diffusion model, we might seed a behavior with the most connected individuals, a randomly selected group, or individuals located in a particular community. These differences allow us to explore how network structure interacts with initial conditions to shape diffusion outcomes—helping us identify strategies that are more robust, equitable, or efficient.


## Models of social diffusion in terms of transmission constraints

1. Going Viral: Unconstrained Contagion
1. Bounded Virality: Diffusion in Finite Populations
1. Viral Friends: Social Networks Constrain Diffusion
1. Guided Virality: Cultural Evolution via Adaptive Social Learning

### Going viral: unconstrained contagion

{{< include Include/unconstrained-contagion.qmd >}}

- Always new learners to teach
- Adoption rate $\alpha$, drop rate $\delta$; $R_0 = \alpha / \delta$.
- Discrete-time diffusion model (difference equation)
- Continuous-time diffusion model (differential equation)
- Simulation (agent-based model)



### Bounded virality: finite population size

- Now at most $N$ agents can adopt the sustainable practice, so marginal
  adoption tapers off over time as more nearly everyone adopts the sustainable
  practice.
- One of the best-known approaches to modeling social diffusion is the
  *contagion* model of transmission, where behaviors are transmitted
  probabilistically as if they were a disease being transmitted interpersonally.
  When people interact in this model, one learns from the other. If the learner
  practes the Exhaust behavior, $E$, and observes or is instructed by a teacher
  who practices the Sustain behavior, $S$, then there is a probability $\alpha$
  that the learner adopts (i.e., begins doing) $S$. $\alpha$ is therefore called
  the *adoption rate*.

### Viral friends: social network constraints on diffusion 


#### The good and the bad of social structure and long-range ties


#### Homophily: choice and induced 

**Homophily** is the tendency for similar individuals to associate. We distinguish two forms:

-   **Choice homophily**, where individuals actively prefer similar partners;
-   **Induced homophily**, where external constraints (e.g., institutions, geography) create segregation even without conscious preference.

Two empirical illustrations:

-   An analysis of remote-work-eligible occupations shows clustering by education, income, and race.
-   A study of minority students in a mostly white MBA program finds that homophily can foster solidarity and resilience.

These examples show that homophily can inhibit or support adaptation, depending on the context.

We also discuss experimental results from Centola (2010, 2011), which show that homophilous networks can outperform random ones in spreading health behaviors—especially when reinforcement and social learning are important.

#### Asymmetric homophily and diffusion

In some cases, homophily is **asymmetric**. One group (often the minority) is more exposed to the other than vice versa. In the "Minority Incubator, Majority Reservoir" model, this asymmetry allows minority-originating adaptations to diffuse outward more effectively.

This structural asymmetry isn’t necessarily intentional—it can emerge from how connections are formed. Yet it has real implications for diffusion, visibility, and adaptation speed.

#### Core-periphery structure

In a **core-periphery** network, a dense core of well-connected individuals is surrounded by a sparsely connected periphery. This structure supports fast diffusion through the core but may limit peripheral influence.

The South Pacific Island case provides an example: core-periphery organization enabled stable adaptation strategies under conditions of uncertainty and risk. These designs may emerge deliberately or organically.

#### When ties break: cumulative loss

To illustrate the consequences of broken connections, we turn to Henrich’s study of tool diversity in Oceania. When long-range maritime ties between islands broke down, isolated communities lost complex technologies.

This example highlights how network fragmentation can halt or reverse cumulative cultural evolution—a key dynamic in adaptation and innovation.

### Guided virality: cultural evolution via social learning

- Culture truly evolves when people preferentially select teachers who seem
  more successful than alternatives or are better socially connected, 
  or when people preferentially adopt behaviors that seem to
  be practiced more widely than others, or any similar social learning strategy.
  Being able to flexibly probe, sample, and integrate different sources of social and
  asocial information is a fundamental part of what it means to be human
  [@Witt2024]. Over time, stable cultural practices become established as
  various social learning strategies exercised flexibly by individuals weed out 
  less desirable Behavioral norms serve as heuristics for
  individual decision-making contingencies, such as how much to share 
  of a publicly-visible and shareable gift, or gendered division of labor from
  the relatively harmless decision of which gender leads in a social partner
  dance to who is responsible for more household chores and has freer access to
  liquid household resources or credit [@OConnor2019]. 
  We know because different cultures have different norms encoding different
  motivations for behavior in economic decisions and reasoning in general,
  self-concept, and reasoning in general, that systematically affect behavior in
  similar ways within, but not between, cultures in general [@Henrich2010].
- Of the many foundations of humanity is the unrivaled capacity to learn from
  others, with adaptations that help us decide from whom to learn, such as
  preferentially from the most apparently fit social network neighbors, or what
  features of a behavior are most desirable, such as a high prevalence of
  behavioral adoption. 
- Because of the non-linear nature of either form of adaptive social learning,
  attaining *closed-form* solutions to the formal equations is much more
  difficult and therefore more the domain of matematical biology than
  computational social science. Still, the basic predictions with some key
  simplifying, asymptotic assumptions are accessible to understand, with the
  derivations comprehensible in broad strokes.
- Because formal methods become increasingly restrictive as social behavior
  complexity is increased, simulation becomes more important. At this stage,
  simulation becomes much more accessible to many more social scientists. This
  becomes even more true as we go beyond the well-mixed assumption necessary for
  formal calculations in unconstrained or constrained contagion, and into 
  developing computational models of behavior diffusion where interaction
  structure is represented by a social network.
- NEXT: formalize success- and frequency-biased learning

#### Success-biased social learning

#### Frequency-biased social learning




## Analysis of the various types of social behavior models above

- Unconstrained: vary $\alpha$ and calculate and plot different dynamics
- Contagion in finite: vary $\alpha$ and $\delta$ and plot dynamics; include SES
  model with delta p vs. p as in Smaldino Ch. 4.
- Adaptive social learning: compare success rate curves colored and styled by different
  adaptive fitness values and frequency-biased with x-axis being the initial
  prevalence $p_S(t=0)$.
- Social network structure: (i) success rate over rewiring probability and with
  preferential attachment; (ii) finish homophily example.
